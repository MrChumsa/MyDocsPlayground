# Creating a Zine
It is possible to create a zine quickly and cheaply. This guide explains how to research material for your zine, lay out and prepare your zine for publication, print out and fold the zine, and distribute the zine.

This guide is for people new to creating zines, who might want to use the format for activism, art, or literature.

## Materials and Equipment
* A printer
* A stapler
* Scissors
* 8.5 &times; 11&#8243; (letter) paper

## Step 1: Research Material for a Zine

## Step 2: Lay Out and Prepare the Zine

## Step 3: Print Out and Fold the Zine

1. Print out the necessary number of sheets.

   ℹ️ **Note:** To ensure that the pages of the zine are in the correct sequence when you fold them, make sure your printer prints in the correct page orientation:
   * If your printer is capable of double-sided printing, set it to print on two sides of the sheet and to flip the sheet on the long end.
   * If your printer is incapable of double-sided printing, print all the single sides at once, then flip them and load them back into the printer manually.

1. Allowing the sheet to remain attached in the middle, make two cuts along the dotted lines between pages 1 and 4, and then between pages 8 and 5.

1. Making sure that pages 1, 8, 4, and 5 are facing outwards, fold the sheet to create a crease where the cuts are.

1. Depending on the length of the zine, place one or two staples between pages 1 and 8, along the dotted line.
